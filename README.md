# AI-AGENTIC Knowledge Graph Extractor

## Overview

AI-AGENTIC Knowledge Graph Extractor is a Streamlit-based application designed for extracting and visualizing knowledge graphs from PDF documents. The project leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract entities and relationships, generating structured knowledge representations in JSON-LD format.

## Features

- Upload PDFs: Extract text using PyPDF2.
- Customizable Prompts: Upload text prompts for entity and relationship extraction.
- Chunking: Break down large text into manageable parts for better LLM processing.
- Entity & Relationship Extraction: Automatically identify and categorize materials, processes, properties, and relationships.
- JSON-LD Generation: Output structured JSON-LD files that are ready for visualization.
- API Integration: Supports both OpenAI and Groq APIs for LLM functionality.
- Chain of Thought: Provide better response from LLM

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - streamlit
  - PyPDF2
  - langchain-text-splitters
  - openai
  - chardet
  - groq

To install dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install -r Requirement.txt
```

## Installation Process

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-AGENTIC-KG-EXTRACTOR.git
   cd AI-AGENTIC-KG-EXTRACTOR
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r Requirement
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run mini.py
   ```

1. Upload a PDF file using the interface.
2. Select your preferred API (OpenAI or Groq) and provide an API key.
3. Upload prompt files for:
   - Entity Extraction
   - Relationship Extraction
   - JSON-LD Generation
4. Process the PDF to generate knowledge graphs in JSON-LD format

### Example Output

```json
{
  "@context": "http://emmo.info/emmo#",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "ex:Material_1",
      "@type": "Material",
      "has_property": {
        "@id": "ex:Property_1",
        "value": "520 nm"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
