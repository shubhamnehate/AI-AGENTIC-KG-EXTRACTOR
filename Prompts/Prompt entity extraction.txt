			'"They include solids like metals (iron, aluminum, gold), ceramics (silica, alumina), polymers (polyethylene, natural rubber), and composites (concrete, carbon-fiber). Liquids like solvents (water, acetone), molten metals, and gases such as hydrogen or nitrogen are also considered materials. Chemically, materials span metals, non-metals (carbon, sulfur), alloys (steel, brass), inorganic compounds (sodium chloride), and organic substances (cellulose, proteins). Advanced materials include nanomaterials (graphene, quantum dots), 2D materials (boron nitride), smart materials (shape-memory alloys, piezoelectrics), and energy materials (lithium-ion batteries, perovskites). Natural materials like wood, stone, wool, and silk contrast with synthetic ones such as nylon and Teflon. Materials serve structural (concrete, steel), electronic (silicon, copper), optical (glass, LEDs), magnetic (ferrites, neodymium), and biological (bone, collagen) roles, with specialized forms like powders, fibers, films, and coatings. Reagents (sodium hydroxide), precursors (titanium tetrachloride), additives (plasticizers), and abrasives (diamond dust) further expand their diversity. Found in various environments, they include minerals (quartz), rocks (granite), fossil fuels (coal, petroleum), and even cryogenic substances (liquid nitrogen). "

			"Key types of properties in materials science and engineering encompass various characteristics that define a material's behavior and suitability for applications. Physical properties include density, which is the mass per unit volume (e.g., g/cm³), melting point, the temperature at which a material transitions from solid to liquid (e.g., °C), thermal conductivity, the ability to conduct heat (e.g., W/m·K), and optical properties like transparency, reflectivity, and refractive index. Mechanical properties cover tensile strength, the maximum stress a material can withstand when stretched (e.g., MPa), hardness, which is the resistance to deformation or scratching (e.g., GPa or Mohs scale), elastic modulus, the ratio of stress to strain during elastic deformation (e.g., GPa), and fatigue resistance, the ability to withstand cyclic loading. Chemical properties include corrosion resistance, the ability to resist chemical degradation, reactivity, the tendency to undergo chemical reactions, and solubility, the capacity to dissolve in a solvent. Electrical properties involve conductivity, the ability to conduct electric current (e.g., S/m), resistivity, resistance to electrical flow (e.g., Ω·cm), and dielectric constant, a measure of insulating capacity. Magnetic properties include magnetic permeability, the ability to support the formation of a magnetic field, and coercivity, the resistance to changes in magnetization. Thermal properties include specific heat, the heat capacity per unit mass (e.g., J/kg·K), and thermal expansion, the change in dimensions with temperature (e.g., μm/m·K). Optical properties like reflectance, the ratio of reflected light to incident light, and absorbance, the proportion of light absorbed, are also significant. Lastly, environmental properties include biodegradability, the ability to decompose naturally, and UV stability, resistance to degradation under ultraviolet light. These properties collectively determine how materials perform under various conditions and their application potential."

			Contextual Phrases:Look for descriptions like "resistant to," "characterized by," "measured as," or "exhibits high."Example: "This polymer exhibits high elasticity with a modulus of 0.8 GPa."
			Comparative Descriptions:Properties may be described in relative terms, such as "stronger," "lighter," "more ductile."Example: "This alloy is stronger than conventional steel."
			Conditions or Dependencies:Properties might be linked to specific conditions like temperature, pressure, or environment.Example: "The resistivity increases with temperature."

- Parameter: 
Define:- refers to a specific and quantifiable and measurable factor in the manufacturing process"@en ;
           parameter has a numeric value and the unit.
reference:- "Parameters can be categorized based on their role in experiments, simulations, or operations. Common examples include temperature, pressure, concentration, pH, voltage, current, time, flow rate, and frequency. They may also involve geometric or physical aspects such as thickness, diameter, or surface area, as well as environmental conditions like humidity or light intensity. Parameters often appear alongside units (e.g., °C, atm, mol/L) and are typically specified in literature with descriptive phrases such as "maintained at," "adjusted to," or "measured as." They play a crucial role in defining the behavior, performance, or outcome of a process or material, and their variation is often used to study system responses or optimize results. Parameters are context-specific and directly linked to experimental setups, manufacturing processes, or material properties, providing critical data for analysis and replication."

**node extraction rules**
Follow this struction for extracting the entities:
- Look for any example of materials entity that should be defined as nodes in the knowledge graph with minimal details necessary for understanding the relationship for the knowledge graph
- Materials including surfactants, chemicals, intermediates, products, components, molecules, atoms, devices and solvents.
- Look for main manufacturing that should be defined as nodes in the knowledge graph with minimal details necessary for understanding the relationship
- Extract the name of main manufacturing and ignore all the processes in between
- Look for measurement process that should be defined as nodes in the knowledge graph with minimal details necessary for understanding the relationship
- If a property has multiple distinct values for a material, each value should be represented by a separate property node in the knowledge graph
- If different materials have the same property, each of them should be represented by a separate node in the knowledge graph
- The value of the property must be numeric and accompanied by a unit, and cannot be a string or text
- Parameter for each of the manufacturing should be represented by a separate node in the knowledge graph
- If a parameter has multiple distinct values, each value should be represented by a separate node in the knowledge graph
- The value of the parameter must be numeric and accompanied by a unit, and cannot be a string or text

ALWAYS REMEMBER:

- Extract all the nodes that should be defined as nodes in the knowledge graph with minimal details necessary for understanding the relationship
- Always remember that nodes are newly created entities that should extract from the text.
- Is really IMPORTANT to extract all the nodes. as you are material science expert you know that all surfactants,solutions, chemicals, intermediates, products, components, molecules, atoms, devices and solvents are material.
- As you are material science expert you know that is important to extract all the parameters related to each manufctring and all the properties related to each materials, and extracting them complete and precise.
- focusing solely on extracting nodes for knowledge graph, such as 'Material', 'Manufacturing', 'Measurement', 'Parameter', and 'Property'.
- Please make sure that all abbrivations are linked to the full form as in platinum and Pt if any one is mentioned make sure to mention it liek platinum (pt) and if it is like Platinum on Carbon {Pt/C} Should not be confused. 
- always double check to extract all the entities needed for creating relationships in the knowledge graph
- Avoid extra explanations; directly format the output as:

"Material": [] # it can be a list
"Manufacturing": [] # it can be a list
"Measurement": [] # it can be a list
"Property": [] # it can be a list
"Parameter": [] # it can be a list

the base material. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is then constructed by coating the PEM with a catalyst layer composed of
platinum on carbon (Pt/C), followed by the assembly of the anode and cathode plates on either side. The entire assembly is then compressed and
heated to ensure proper adhesion and electrical contact. Subsequently, the fuel cell is integrated into a hydrogen storage system, which involves
connecting the fuel cell to hydrogen tanks equipped with advanced pressure regulation systems. This integration process is crucial for optimizing the fuel cell's performance and ensuring safe hydrogen storage and delivery.>
