# 🖊️ Marker Tool 
 
> This project is a Python-based application that processes PDFs using Marker pdf and integrates deep learning using PyTorch along with language model enhancements via Groq.

---

## ✨ Features
- **PDF Processing 📄**: Handles PDF input/output using [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) and [ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com/opensource/).  
- **Marker-PDF Integration 🖊️**: Enhances PDF functionalities with [marker-pdf](https://pypi.org/project/marker-pdf/).  
- **Deep Learning Support 🧠**: Powered by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for both CPU and GPU computations.  
- **LLM Enhancements 🤖**: Utilizes [Groq](https://pypi.org/project/groq/) for language model supported data cleaning.  
- **API Key Management 🔒**: Securely stores and uses environment variables for sensitive credentials (e.g., `GROQ_API_KEY`).  

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11 or higher**  
- **GROQ_API_KEY** (if you plan to use Groq-based LLM features)
- **CUDA 11.8** or later (if using GPU capabilities with PyTorch)
